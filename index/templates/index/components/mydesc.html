<p>
    I am, a self-taught Django developer who loves to play video games, watch
    Netflix and anime. I have good understanding of frontend and backend
    technologies with a passion of making creative and fun to use website. I am
    looking for a full-time work as a full-stack Django developer. I can provide
    fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project and always open
    to challenges and constructive feedback and learn new things quickly.
